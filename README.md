# Kickstarting with Excel
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends 

## Overview of Project

### Purpose and Background

Louis's play _Fever_ came close to its fundraising goal in a short amount of time. She wants to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. Using the Kickstarter dataset (specifically subcategory of "plays"), we wanted to visualize campaign outcomes based on their launch dates and their funding goals.
